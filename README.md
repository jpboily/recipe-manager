Management tool for favorite recipes

My girlfriend and I have discovered a passion for food and we try to discover as many recipes as possible through different sources. Though this is fun, we end up with a lack of knowledge on which recipe was were. So I had the idea of creating an application that would allow us to keep and index on our favorite recipes with the ingredient list and our appreciation on each recipe. This way, we have a permanent access to all the recipes we prefer.

It is important to note that all recipes were acquired through either a paid subscription to magazine, a cooking book that we bought or on the internet. All recipes MUST have a reference to its origin everytime it is accessed, shared or printed.

This project is also intended to get back on Ruby On Rails which I have used in 2007 working on version 2. It is also a good opportunity to familiarize with GitHub which I have explored a lot, but it's my first usage of this project has a Git Server. I have only navigated on the platform to download open source project.
